# Getting Started with Prometheus

This is a docker version of "Hello world" example of Prometheus. I followed the
getting started guide of Prometheus in [https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/).

## How to run it?

```bash
docker-compose up --scale client_golang=3
```
